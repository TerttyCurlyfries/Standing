Early idea I had once I had gotten more comfortable with C and the Pebble platform. App can save location of user and then tell them how to get back to that location. Intended to save your parking spot, or maybe some place special you were at with your someone special. Location algorithm was wildly inaccurate, and I never finished the navigation code to get the user back to the spot they saved. Will most likely never be finished, but there's a chance.
